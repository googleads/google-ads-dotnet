## Contributing

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement.
You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission
to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to
https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was
for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

### How Libraries are Generated

This section is intended to provide background regarding how we generate our client libraries so
that you only submit pull requests that we will be able to use (we don’t want you wasting your
time). We automatically generate the majority of our client library code from these
[protocol buffers](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/ads/googleads)
that define the API. As a result, the names of certain methods and variables may be
created automatically. Generated code is generally located in folders with the name of a
version, such as v1 or v2. We will not be able to accept pull requests for open source
improvements to the codebase related to generated code. Please share any feedback of this
nature by [creating an issue](#providing-feedback) as we may be able to make fixes
to the code generation process internally. We also welcome any pull requests related to
this library not related to generated code.

### Pull Request Submission Best Practices

If your pull request does not address an existing issue, we suggest
[creating an issue](#providing-feedback) outlining your proposed changes to
ensure they align with the existing roadmap and are able to be accepted.
When making a pull request, first make your own forked copy of this repository, make any changes
on a separate branch of that forked copy, then submit the pull request from your new fork/branch.
Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
for more information on using pull requests.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. Upon receiving your
pull request, our team will review the changes and may provide you with feedback, questions,
or comments in order to maintain a high level of quality throughout this repository. We ask
that you address feedback in a timely manner so that we can merge your changes into the main branch.

### Style Guidelines & Naming Conventions

Please conform your submitted code to the official C# 
[style guide for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).
In addition, please leave comments in your code in a manner consistent with other code in this repository.

### Claiming Requests

If you see a feature request or bug in the issues list for which you would like to submit a pull
request, please let us know by “claiming” the request in the comments, and we can assign the
issue to you. This will help to avoid duplicate work.

### Testing

If you make any changes to this codebase, ensure that all existing tests continue to pass.
In addition, add tests that validate your changes to ensure that future changes do not break
your new feature or bug fix.
