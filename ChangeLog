  for release notes.
- Removed support for v1 of Google Ads API. See sunset reminder for v1 at
  https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/google-ads-api-beta-v1-sunset-reminder.html. We are
  doing a major version bump for the library, since removing support for an API version is backward
  incompatible change.

3.0.0
=====
- Bumped gRPC dependency to 2.29.0. Since this is a breaking change as per the gRPC team, we
  have made a corresponding bump in the major version of this library. See
  https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/L57-csharp-new-major-version.md to learn more about
  the gRPC changes.
- The library dependencies were bumped as listed below:
  - Google.Protobuf: 3.12.2.
  - Grpc.Core and related assemblies: 2.29.0
  - Google.Api.Gax.Grpc and related assemblies: 3.0.0
  - Google.LongRunning: 2.0.0
  - .NET: netstandard2.0;net472 for libraries, and netcoreapp3.0;net472 for executables.
- Fixed https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-dotnet/issues/163
- Fixed https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-dotnet/issues/120
- Removed several method flattenings that involved validateOnly and partialFailure parameters. The
  library provides method flattenings as convenience methods for the most common API use cases. Since
  validateOnly and partialFailure parameters are optional for most of the API use cases (and default
  to false), these overloaded methods provide limited value to developers and tend to confuse them.
  We recommend using the method that uses the Request object as parameter as a replacement. You can
  compare Remarketing\UploadOfflineConversion.cs as an example on how this affects the method usage.
  The other updated code examples are:
  - ErrorHandling\HandleRateExceededError.cs
  - ErrorHandling\HandlePartialFailure.cs
  - Remarketing\UploadOfflineConversion.cs
  - Remarketing\UploadConversionAdjustment.cs
  - Remarketing\UploadCallConversion.cs
  - Remarketing\AddCustomerMatchUserList.cs
  - CampaignManagement\ValidateTextAd.cs

- Fixed AddShoppingProductListingGroupTree example to work with v3.
- Made changes to logging and exception handling framework to support streaming methods.
- The generated stubs no longer use the ExceptionCustomization feature of gax libraries, since the
exception handling logic have moved to grpc interceptors. These stub classes have been removed from
the distribution.
- Convert GetCampaigns and GetKeywordStats examples to use server streaming.
 See https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/reporting/streaming to learn more about
 server streaming.
- Add an empty `custom_nupkg` folder in the repo to help with testing dependent packages that are
 custom-built from GitHub sources.
- Fixed the visibility of several test classes and methods.
- Added new code examples:
  - AddPrices
  - AddGoogleMyBusinessLocationExtensions

- Added tests for some code examples. All new code examples will have tests, tests for previous code
 examples will be backfilled in upcoming releases.
- Signing was added to Google.Ads.GoogleAds.Examples.csproj to facilitate tests for code examples.
- Fixed https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-dotnet/issues/118. You can now extend GoogleAdsConfig
 class, override CreateCredentials() method to provide your own logic for caching credentials.
- Removed JsonBodyFormatter and TraceFormatter classes. Since the library works with proto objects,
 it is cleaner to do the formatting directly with the objects instead of converting it into a Json
 object and processing it. Part of the relevant functionality was pulled into LogEntry class.
- Additional null checks were added into LoggingInterceptor::GetPartialFailures() method. This provides
 a less noisy debugging experience as well as better performance.
- Fixed https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-dotnet/issues/117
- https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-dotnet/issues/116
- Fixed broken tests in GoogleAdsClientTests suite and GoogleAdsServiceClientFactoryTests suite. Also
  fixed StubIntegrityTestHelper.cs to work with the fixed suites.

 until https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/17 is fixed for netcore and makes its way
 into a stable release.
- Remove reference to Google.Ads.GoogleAds nuget package in Google.Ads.GoogleAds.Tests.csproj. Tests
should build and run against the csproj instead.
- Added nuget package references to the new nuget packages for .NET SDK. This allows you to build
 .NET SDK projects using dotnet command only.
- Refactored the tests suite.
  - Move ExampleTestsBase.cs to v2 folder.
  - Add an ExamplesTestSetup.cs file for single-place initialization for the whole test suite.
  - Add an ExampleTestsUtils.cs file with several methods for Setup for tests.
- Fixed https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-dotnet/issues/99

2.6.0
=====
- Optimize for a check on section name if it is empty in the GoogleAdsConfig class.
