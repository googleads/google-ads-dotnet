# ASP.NET Web Application example for Google Ads Client Library for .NET

This project demonstrates how to use the Google Ads .NET client library in a web application. In
addition to making an API call and rendering the results, we also demonstrate how to authorize the
user using OAuth2 web flow and extract the refresh and access tokens. You can use this application
as a reference point when building your own web applications that require user authentication.

This web application uses ASP.NET Web Forms, which is considered legacy technology by the broader
.NET developer community. However, Google Ads .NET client library fully supports
.NET SDK (4.7.2+), and this code example is provided for the users who are still using this
technology in their application.

If you are developing a new application, you should instead look at the AuthenticateInWebApplication
code example, which is written as an ASP.NET Core web application.
