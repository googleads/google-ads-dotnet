# ASP.NET Core Web Application example for Google Ads Client Library for .NET

This project demonstrates how to use the Google Ads .NET client library in an ASP.NET Core web
application. In addition to making an API call and rendering the results, we also demonstrate how
to authorize the user using OAuth2 web flow and extract the refresh and access tokens. You can use
this application as a reference point when building your own web applications that require user
authentication.

If you are using ASP.NET, then consider referring to the AuthenticateInAspNetWebApplication instead.
