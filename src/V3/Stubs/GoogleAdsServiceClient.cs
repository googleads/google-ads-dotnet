        ///
        /// - Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused.
        ///   For example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if
        ///   the mutate order was reversed.
        /// - Temp names are not remembered across requests.
        /// - There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request.
        /// - Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the resource
        ///   types differ.

        /// ## Latency

        /// It's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time
