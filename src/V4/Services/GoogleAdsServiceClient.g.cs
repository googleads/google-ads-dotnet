        /// campaign budget is created with `resource_name` equal to
        /// `customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1`, that resource name can be reused in
        /// the `Campaign.budget` field in the same request. That way, the two
        /// resources are created and linked atomically.
        /// 
        /// To create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the part of the
        /// name that the server would normally allocate.
        /// 
        /// Note:
        /// 
        /// - Resources must be created with a temp name before the name can be reused.
        /// For example, the previous CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if
        /// the mutate order was reversed.
        /// - Temp names are not remembered across requests.
        /// - There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request.
        /// - Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the resource
        /// types differ.
        /// 
        /// ## Latency
        /// 
        /// It's important to group mutates by resource type or the request may time
        /// out and fail. Latency is roughly equal to a series of calls to individual
        /// mutate methods, where each change in resource type is a new call. For
        /// example, mutating 10 campaigns then 10 ad groups is like 2 calls, while

        /// 
        /// This method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate methods. The
        /// only features it offers over calling those methods directly are:
